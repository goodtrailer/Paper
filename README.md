# Paper v0.7.1
UE4 videogame based on paper board games I used to play as a kid. It is multiplayer through IP connections like Minecraft. It works over LAN and can work over the internet either through port forwarding or direct-linking P2P VPNs like Hamachi/Wippien. It also works for local play if you load up the game twice and enter localhost or 127.0.0.1 as the IP. Source-engine-like server list coming next using Epic Online Services. Versions.txt is a todo-list of upcoming updates.<br />
